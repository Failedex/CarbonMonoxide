I switch between these versions whenever I feel like it. They both exist in this repo.

## Featuring
- Oxocarbon color scheme
- Eww bar, dock, and widgets
- Eww animations (quite a lot of them)
- "Touch friendly" set up (configuration was made for my touchscreen laptop)
- Other themes
- The worst configuration files you have ever seen
- A few [symptoms](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carbon-monoxide/symptoms-causes/syc-20370642), only a few.

## Dependencies 

The config will still run without these, but there will be silent errors and missing features. 
- Iosevka Nerd Font and Symbols Nerd Font
- pamixer
- brightnessctl
- nmcli
- playerctl
- mpDris2 (and mpd I guess)
- grim and wl-copy
- python3 (and i3ipc, gobject)
- wvkbd-mobintl (for touchscreen purposes)
- wofi
- foot
- swaylock
- a file under `~/Documents/fuck.txt`. This is a to-do list

## Set up 
### Warning: This configuration is barely tested on other devices, it is much safer to use this as a reference.
It should be possible to set this configuration up using 
```
stow .
```

If there are any conflicts, move your current configurations somewhere else. I encourage users to look through the config and make your own changes, because the defaults are tailored to my preferences, and my preference is a bit silly.
