# EWWWTF - badly made eww widgets

very hacky config, will deplete your sanity, read at your own risk

you could clone this somewhere in your eww configuration folder but you will definitely need to change some values within eww.yuck and scripts/launch

it might be easier to use this as a reference instead
or like, just don't use these badly made widgets lmao
